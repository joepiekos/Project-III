# Project-III

OVERVIEW:
Files here are supplementary material to my 3rd year mathematics project: <br />
-The dissertation focuses on a branch of statistics known as functional data analysis (FDA), to analyse data collected over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br />
-The aim is to compare smaller scale epidemics in each county of the UK, and characterise their shapes as curves. <br />
-I use mortality, mobility and positivity data as "functional" variables and look at the statistical relationship between them. <br />
-The final dissertation is also available for download from the github repo for anyone interested.

BEFORE RUNNING CODE: 
- Load the data and packages into R using the "load data and packages.R" file
- Data can be downloaded from this github repo as .csv files, and the user will have to adjust file path names when loading data to fit their personal file explorer
