# Project-III
Files here are mainly supplementary material for my 3rd year mathematics project, in particular in statistics:
-It focuses on using functional data analysis (FDA) to analyse data collected over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic
-The aim is to compare smaller scale epidemics around the UK, and characterise their shapes as curves.
-I use mortality, mobility and positivity data as "functional" variables and look at the statistical relationship between them
