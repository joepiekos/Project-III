# Project-III
Files here are mainly supplementary material for my 3rd year mathematics project:
-It focuses on a current branch of statistics known as functional data analysis (FDA), to analyse data collected over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
-The aim is to compare smaller scale epidemics in each county of the UK, and characterise their shapes as curves.
-I use mortality, mobility and positivity data as "functional" variables and look at the statistical relationship between them.
