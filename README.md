# Project-III

OVERVIEW:
Files here are supplementary material for my 3rd year mathematics project:
-It focuses on a current branch of statistics known as functional data analysis (FDA), to analyse data collected over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
-The aim is to compare smaller scale epidemics in each county of the UK, and characterise their shapes as curves.
-I use mortality, mobility and positivity data as "functional" variables and look at the statistical relationship between them.
-The final dissertation is also available for download from the github repo for anyone interested.

BEFORE RUNNING CODE: 
- load the data and packages into R using the "load data and packages.R" files
- data can be downloaded from this github repo, and the user will have to adjust file path names when loading data
